For ALIASMETHOD:
This generates a user specified number of values as described in the keithschwartz article.

It currently prints a list of the values given in VOSERUNNER.

In VOSERUNNER, you can edit the dist by adding, subrtacting and editing weights and titles of variables. Follow basic format
already shown in VOSERUNNER.

A histogram of the results is also printed, but I am having trouble with it as of 2.14.18.
