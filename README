For ALIASMETHOD:
This generates a user specified number of values as described in the keithschwartz article.

It currently prints a list of the values given in VOSERUNNER.

In VOSERUNNER, you can edit the dist by adding, subrtacting and editing weights and titles of variables. Follow basic format
already shown in VOSERUNNER.

EDIT 2.20.18:
Moved some of the code around, now only one method is called from voseRunner.py, now put values in as before but put in 'n' in the call
to VA now. This allows us to make sure no negative values in weights. Also added fnctionality to histogram.

-----RUN VOSERUNNER AFTER YOU HAVE MADE THE CHANGES YOU WANT TO MAKE------
